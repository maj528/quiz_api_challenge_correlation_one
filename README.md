## Thoughts on project

I enjoyed this project and it created a lot of opportunities to learn. At first, I found it difficult to conceptualise exclusively the backend without any frontend work. However, physically drawing out the database and the assessment interactions helped enormously. With more time, I would further refine the timer, the final submission of the assignment, implement a grading mechanism, create effective seeds, and use Capybara for testing. I learned how to use Swagger.io to document the API, and I hope you enjoy my API!
